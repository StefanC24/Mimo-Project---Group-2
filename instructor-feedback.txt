Overall Feedback:

1. The css for the most part is well organised and using the best practices.
2. HTML is using the correct tags and does not have any unnecessary code.
3. The JavaScript mostly is well organised but has some areas for improvement
as noted in the JS file.
4. Git commit messages could be clearer as to what changed from version to version.
